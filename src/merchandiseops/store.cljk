  "SSoT for the ISIC-4719 'Other retail sale in non-specialized stores'
  (general-merchandise/department-store retail -- a general-merchandise or
  department store without predominant food sales, distinct from ISIC 4711's
  predominantly-food community retail) operations-COORDINATION actor, behind
  a `Store` protocol so the backend is a swap, not a rewrite -- the same
  seam every `cloud-itonami-isic-*` actor in this fleet uses.

  This actor coordinates the back-office operations of a general-merchandise
  storefront: sales/inventory/return transaction logging, floor-staff
  scheduling, merchandise supply-order coordination with registered vendors,
  and loss-prevention-concern flagging (shoplifting, inventory shrinkage,
  product-safety observations). It never sets or authorizes a shelf price,
  never finalizes a loss-prevention-enforcement action (detention, search,
  arrest), and never itself detains or searches anyone -- see
  `merchandiseops.governor`'s `scope-exclusion-violations`, a HARD,
  permanent, un-overridable block.

  `MemStore` -- atom of EDN. The deterministic default for dev/tests/demo
  (no deps). A `stores` directory keyed by `:store-id` STRING and a
  `vendors` directory keyed by `:vendor-id` STRING (never keywords --
  consistent keying from the start, avoiding the silent-miss bug that has
  plagued earlier sibling actors).

  A registered/verified store record (business registration + retail
  license) must exist before ANY proposal targeting that store may ever
  commit or escalate -- `merchandiseops.governor`'s
  `store-unverified-violations` re-derives this from the store's own
  `:registered?`/`:verified?` fields, never from proposal self-report. A
  `:coordinate-supply-order` proposal additionally names a registered
  vendor via its own `:vendor-id`; the SAME 'ground truth, not self-report'
  discipline applies via `vendor-unverified-violations` -- the flagship
  genuinely new check this vertical adds (a supply-chain-specific
  counterparty-verification gate no sibling 47xx actor has).

  The ledger stays append-only: which store a proposal targeted, which
  operation, on what basis, committed/held/escalated and approved by whom
  is always a query over an immutable log.")
